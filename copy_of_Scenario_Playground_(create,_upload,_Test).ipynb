        "    1.  `\\\"{objective}\\\"`: Clearly define the central theme, argument, or scenario the video script should focus on. This is the core message Jay will deliver.\n",
        "    2.  `[{today_date}]`: Specify the current month and year (e.g., \"October 2024\"). This will be used to define the end date for case study searches.\n",

        "    **OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**\n",

        "    1.  **Format:** A single-speaker narration script for a video.\n",
        "    2.  **Speaker:** The script must be written from the perspective of \"Jay,\" an AI Coach.\n",
        "    3.  **Opening Line:** The script *must* begin *exactly* with: `Hey this is Jay. Your AI Coach.` (No variations allowed).\n",
        "    4.  **Tone & Style:**\n",
        "        *   **Opinionated & Strong:** Present a clear, potentially controversial stance on the `\\\"{objective}\\\"`.\n",
        "        *   **Engaging Hook:** Start strong to grab attention immediately. Aim for language that sparks curiosity or challenges common assumptions, suitable for platforms like LinkedIn or YouTube, but maintaining professionalism for an enterprise audience.\n",
        "        *   **Authoritative & Coaching:** Jay should sound knowledgeable and directive, as expected from a coach in a management development context.\n",
        "    5.  **Content - Case Studies:**\n",
        "        *   Include **three (3) real-life examples/case studies** that strongly illustrate the point being made about the `\\\"{objective}\\\"`.\n",
        "        *   **Recency:** These examples *must* reference events, decisions, or published outcomes that occurred between **January 1, 2023, and the `[April,30 2025]` provided by the user.**\n",
        "        *   **Verifiability:** For each example, include specific details (e.g., company name, specific initiative, reported outcome, relevant timeframe) and **cite a verifiable public reference** (e.g., reputable news article link, official company press release link, widely reported event). The reference should allow someone to cross-verify the claim. *Note: Finding 3 perfectly fitting, publicly referenced examples within this specific recent timeframe can be challenging; prioritize accuracy and relevance.*\n",
        "    6.  **Target Audience:** The script's complexity, language, and examples should be suitable for **Management Development Programs within enterprise companies.**\n",
        "    7.  **Length & Pacing:** Aim for a script that can be delivered naturally in **under 2 minutes**. This typically translates to approximately **250-300 words**. Keep all sentences brief—ideally under **10-15 words.** *Do NOT mention the word count anywhere in the generated script itself.*\n",
        "    8.  **Exclusions:**\n",
        "        *   Do **NOT** include any title for the video script.\n",
        "        *   Do **NOT** include typical YouTube/video calls to action (e.g., \"like, share, subscribe,\" \"hit the bell icon,\" \"link in description\").\n",
        "        *   Do **NOT** include any closing remarks or sign-offs (e.g., \"Thanks for watching,\" \"See you next time,\" \"This has been Jay\"). The script should end after the main content/final point is delivered.\n",
